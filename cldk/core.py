"""Core CLDK module.

This module provides the top-level entry point for the Code Language Development
Kit (CLDK), a unified framework for performing static analysis across multiple
programming languages. The primary interface is the :class:`CLDK` class, which
serves as a factory for creating language-specific analysis objects, tree-sitter
parsers, and sanitization utilities.

The CLDK supports the following languages:
    - **Java**: Full static analysis via CodeAnalyzer backend, including symbol
      tables, call graphs, and code metrics.
    - **Python**: Static analysis via codeanalyzer-python backend (Jedi plus
      PyCG call-graph construction).

Typical usage involves instantiating :class:`CLDK` with a target language, then
calling :meth:`CLDK.analysis` to obtain a language-specific analysis facade.

Note:
    This module requires language-specific backends to be available:
    - Java: ``codeanalyzer-java`` (the ``cldk[java]`` extra; carries the jar and its JVM)
    - Python: ``codeanalyzer-python`` (auto-installed in virtualenv)
