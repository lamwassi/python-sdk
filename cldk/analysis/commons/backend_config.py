"""Backend configuration objects for the CLDK analysis facades.

The CLDK front end selects analysis behavior along two orthogonal axes: the *language* (chosen by
which :class:`~cldk.core.CLDK` factory method is called) and the *backend* (chosen by the **type**
of the configuration object passed as ``backend=``). The dataclasses here are those configuration
objects -- Parameter Objects that the facades ingest and dispatch on.

Two backend families exist:

* :class:`CodeAnalyzerConfig` (and its language-specific subclasses) selects the in-process
  codeanalyzer backend, which runs the packaged ``codeanalyzer-*`` binary and caches its
  ``analysis.json`` under a language-keyed cache directory.
* :class:`Neo4jConnectionConfig` selects the read-only Neo4j/Cypher backend, which answers the
  same queries over a graph populated out of band.

The per-language ``*Backend`` unions below are the discriminated unions the facades match on.
